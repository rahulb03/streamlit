1. Lal Kitab : An Astrological Marvel Lal Kitab, originally published in urdu language, enshrines such effective astrological prin- ciples and remedial measures that it has rightly been termed as (cid:147)The Wonder Book(cid:148) of As- trology. The science of palmistry too has been explained in such an exquisite manner that each of the 42 divisions of the human brain have been related to the different houses of a man(cid:146)s birth chart in such a scientific manner that the sketch of the human brain reflects accurately on the lines of the palm. On the basis of these lines of the palm one can draw the actual horoscope of an individual and can do the placement of planets in various houses of the birth chart. The date of birth and the birth ascendant can be found out by reading the lines and mounts of the palm, which means that an individual(cid:146)s accurate birth chart can be drawn by seeing the lines of his palm. Similarly, by studying the different aspects of a man(cid:146)s residential house his birth chart can be accurately prepared on the basis of the sutras explained in the Lal Kitab. In addition to the above, Lal Kitab has announced unique remedial measures to solve chronic and critical human problems in day to day life.These measures do not require the practice of ordeals, yagnas, havans and other complicated and expensive rituals, which prove more troublesome for persons who are already in trouble because of the evil effects of certain planets. These measures are again different from Yantras, Mantras and Tantras, which give various adverse effects if not fol- lowed rigorously in all their minute details. The measures suggested in Lal Kitab are electrically effective in solving all kinds of human troubles and tensions, without inflicting harm on anybody i.e. these remedies are completely self defensive against the evils created by the planets without causing injury in anyway to anyone concerned. The first part of this great treatise contains the principles and Sutras for interpretation of horoscope, termed as (cid:147)Vyakaran(cid:148). The birth chart of an individual is prepared like the traditional Parashar principles, but the only important difference is that the Rashis are not considered or taken into account for predictive astrology and, therefore, the digits indicating the Rashis in a tra- ditional birth chart are scrapped. Secondly, for predictive purposes the ascendant is treated as the first house and it is regarded as the house of the first Rashi, i.e., Aries and counting progres- sively in a sequence upto the 12th house being that of Pisces.The specific principles of predictive astrology as per Lal Kitab are better summed up here as follows 1.(cid:160)(cid:160)The Sun as lord of the 5th, the Mercury as lord of the 3rd and 6th, the Jupiter as lord of the 9th and the Saturn as lord of the 10th are directly or indirectly in some form or the other are the Karakas of the father and his property. But the Jupiter and the Sun, Jupiter and Mercury or Jupiter and Saturn occupying any house jointly carry no relevance to the knowledge about father or father(cid:146)s property at all. Even Mercury and Sun, Mercury and Saturn or Sun and Saturn also sitting together behave in the same manner. 2.(cid:160)(cid:160)If two or more inimical planets are occupying a single house, they will not behave as enemies. But it does not mean that they do not affect the influences of each other and show their own results of being in that house independently i.e. their conjuction does not affect their individual results. 3.(cid:160)(cid:160)Friendly planets together occupying a house become extremely friendly and help each other in producing good and auspicious results. 4.(cid:160)(cid:160)The 7th house is regarded as the Pucca Ghar (permanent house) of Mercury. If Mercury is placed in the 7th house of a horoscope, even the powerful planets like Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn occupying a Kendra, 2nd or 11th house can not affect the health of the native adversely. 5.(cid:160)(cid:160)If a female planet is placed in any house along with Saturn and both are being aspected by any
--- Page 3 ---
other planet, then the aspecting planet will become afflicted and affect adversely the persons and relatives of such aspecting planet as Karakas. 6.(cid:160)(cid:160)In general, all planets in their Pucca Ghar, own house or exalted house give good results. A planet in inimical house or in a house of debilitation gives bad results. If a planet is not placed in his Pucca Ghar and the same is occupied by a planet inimical to such planet, then that planet will destroy the good results of the house in which he stands placed. 7.(cid:160)(cid:160)While examining a horoscope, the 1st, 7th, 8th and 11th houses must be examined together as they are mutually interested. The planets in the ascendant is treated as a ruler and the one in the 7th acts as his minister. The planet in the 8th is the eye of that ruler, whereas the planet in the 11th house is the ruler(cid:146)s foot. More planets in the 7th house than the 1st house shows that the ruler does not have required control over his minister. If the planets in the 11th house are inimical to the planets in the first house, then they will not obey the command of the ruler i.e., the results of the 11th house will be adversely affected. The planets of the 8th house (eyes) guide the planets of the 7th house (minister) and control their actions and effects. If the planets of the 1st and 8th houses are friendly, then the planet in the 7th house can not play any mischief. Mars in the 7th is considered to be highly conducive for gaining large property. But if mercury is in the Lagna, it will destroy the properties. It will be destroyed because of the foolishness of the native, because here the Mercury being in the first house is Karaka of the native. At the same time if the Mercury is in the 8th house, it will again destroy the properties, but here the reasons for destination will be unknown and invisible, because the active elements of the 8th house are always secretive and mysterious in nature over which the native has no control. Similarly, if the planets of the 1st and 11th houses destination are friendly, they will control the planets of the 7th house. If they are inimical, the results would be bad. The planets of the 1st house aspect the planets of the 7th house. If they are mutually inimical, then the bad results accrue because of the foolishness or unworthiness of the native. The planets of the 8th house aspect the planets of the 2nd house and thereby affect their results. 8. 2nd, 6th, 8th, 12th and 11th houses must also be examined simaltaneouosly as follows : (a) The planets of the 8th house aspect the 2nd house and thereby affect the results of the 2nd house. The effects of the aspects of the planets of the 8th house over the 2nd house are affected by the planets of the 11th house - favourably if friendly and unfavourably if inimical. (b) The planets of the 2nd house aspect the 6th house and affects its results. The planets of the 6th and 8th houses have secret relations with each other, because of which they also affect the planets of the 2nd house (+++). (c) The 12th house also affects the 2nd house (+++). If there are evil planets in the 6th and 8th houses, (because of their secret/implied conjunction) their evil power increases 10 times. (d) If the planets in the 12th and 8th houses are inimical, the native should not visit temples and other places of worship. 9. The 3rd, 11th, 5th, 9th and 10th houses must also be examined simaltaneously as follows : (a) If there is any planet in the 3rd house, it will start showing effects after the birth of the native(cid:146)s
--- Page 4 ---
younger brother. If the 9th and 5th houses are occupied by Saturn Rahu or Ketu then the unfavourable changes start coming up in the native(cid:146)s life just after the birth of the child. (b) If there are good planets in the 9th house and there is no planet in the 2nd house, the native remains deprived of all the benefits. (c) If there is no planet in the 4th house, or it is occupied by Rahu, Ketu or Saturn, then the good results of the 10th house will not be received by the native. If 10th and 2nd houses are empty, the good results of the 4th house will go waste. (d) If the 3rd and 9th houses are bad, the 5th will also prove bad. (e) If the 9th is occupied by Sun or Moon, the 5th house will give good results. (f) If the 9th is occupied by Sun or Moon, then Rahu or Ketu in the 5th will neither affect the issues of the native or the native himself adversely. (g) If Rahu or Ketu be placed in the 5th and there are inimical planets in the 8th then strokes of misfortune will hit the native through the 11th house. The relatives indicated by the planets of the 5th and 8th houses will also be affected. In this situation the earnings of the native will also be affected very adversely, if the 2nd house is empty. Nothing will be able to save the native. Now the planets of the 10th and 5th will also turn to be malefics whatever be their natural charecter.

2. Sun : Effects and Remedies The second chapter of Lal Kitab, termed as the wonder Book of Astrology, details the effects of Sun in various houses alongwith the remedies. The sun, eulogised by the(cid:160)author of the Lal Kitab as Vishnu, the lord of presentation, is the father of our solar system, around which all planets resulve. The power of light in the sky, the temperature of the earth, the power of presentation and progress are represented by the sun. His presence means the (cid:147)day(cid:148) and absence means the (cid:147)night(cid:148). The soul in human body and the power of rendering bodily services to others have also been referred to the Sun - a royal planet of power, authority and finances. The Sun provides good results if placed in houses 1 to 5,8,9,11 and 12. The 6th, 7th, and 10th are bad houses for the Sun. The Moon, the Jupiter and the Mars are the planets friendly to the Sun, where the Saturn, Venus, Rahu and Ketu are enemies. The first is the Puccka Ghar, the permanent house and the house of exaltation of the Sun, whereas the 7th house is in the house of debilitation. The Mars in the 6th and Ketu in the Ist house make the Sun produce results of an exalted planet. If the Sun is exalted or placed in an auspicious house of a person(cid:146)s horoscope he is bound to rise higher and higher in power and position. If obstacles are created against him by a person that person is bound to meet his doom. Much better results are proposed if the Sun is in conjunction with Mercury. The Sun gives adverse effects on the things associated with the house in which he is placed. Conse- quently in the Ist house he will create health problems for the native. In the 2nd house he will affect the family and its comforts absolutely adversely. The sun in the 6th house will not prove good for the sisters and daughters of the native. In the 7th he will face obstacles in the comforts of the wife. The Sun of the 8th house will saue the native from death in critical situations. The sun of the 9th house will destroy the comforts of the forefathers and perhaps deprive the native of their properties. In the 10th, the sun will affect the father adversely. The sun in the 11th increases and multiplies the income of the native manifold, if he does not augment the power of Saturn by cosumption of liquor, meat and eggs. The Sun in the 12th house destroys the comforts of the night hour sleep of the native. The Sun will not be able to harm Venus when sun is being aspected by Saturn because Saturn and Venus are great friends. On the contrary, if Saturn is being aspected by Sun, then the Sun will not be afraid of Saturn and he will destroy the Venus as both are natural enemies in the house where he is placed. The effects of the Sun in both the situations in different houses are as below : Sun in Ist House Benefic : (1) The native will be fond of constructing religious buildings and digging of wells for public purposes. He will have permanent source of livelihood- more from the government. Money earned from honest sources will keep multiplying. He will believe only his eyes, not in ears.

3. Moon : Effects and Remedies As explained in the preceding issue, the Sun is regarded as the generator of power that gives spirit and life to all planets, the Moon is considered to be the conductor of power lent by Sun and rules over the lives of the beings on this earth. Sun represents individuality, whereas Moon shows one(cid:146)s personality. Moon governs over impregnation, conception, birth of a child and the animal instinct. She repre- sents mother, mother(cid:146)s family, grandmother, old women, horse, navigation, agricultural land, Lord Shiva, love, kindness, mental peace, heart, services rendered for other(cid:146)s welfare and the 4th house. The Moon(cid:146)s effect comes up in the 16th, 51st and 86th year of the native and similarly its 1st cycle falls in the 24th year, the 2nd in the 49th year and the 3rd cycle falls in the 94th year of the native. The Jupiter, Sun and Mars are Moon(cid:146)s friends, whereas Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are inimical to her. For her protection, the Moon sacrifies her friendly planets - Sun, Mars or Jupiter. Moon is the Lord of 4th house, stands exalted in the 2nd house of Taurus and becomes debilitated in the 8th house of Scorpio. The Moon provides very good results if placed in houses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 whereas the 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th and 12th houses are bad for the Moon. The death of a domestic milch animal or a horse, drying up of a person(cid:146)s well or pond, the loss of the senses of touching and feeling are the signs of moon turning malefic. The placement of the Ketu in the 4th house causes Matri Rina i.e. mother(cid:146)s debt. In such a situation pieces of silver of equal weight and size be collected from every member of the family and the same should be thrown together into the running water of a river. Consequently all the ill effects would be warded off. Moon in Ist House In general, the 1st house belongs to Mars and Sun. When the moon is also placed therein, this house will come under the combined influences of the Mars, the Sun and the Moon i.e. all the 3 mutual friends will be treated as occupants of this house. The Sun and Mars will extend all friendly support to their natural friend Moon placed on the throne i.e. the ascendant house. Such native will be soft-hearted and will inherit all the traits and qualities of his mother. He will be either the eldest brother or will certainly be treated so. As long as the native receives the blessings of his mother and keeps her happy, he will continue to rise and prosper in every way. The things and the relatives as represented by Mercury, who is inimical to Moon, will prove harm- ful to the native, e.g., the sister-in-law and the green color will affect adversely. Hence it is better to keep away from them. Burning milk (for making Khoya) or selling milk for profit would reduce or minimize the power of the Moon placed in the 1st house, which means that the native(cid:146)s life and property would be de- stroyed if he engages himself in such activities. Such a native should serve others with water and milk freely for long life and all round prosperity. Such a native will get a life of about 90 years and will be bestowed with honours and fame by the Govt. Remedies 1. Do not marry between the age of 24 and 27 years, i.e., marry either before 24 years of age or after 27 years of age. 2. Do not build a house out of your earnings between 24 and 27 years of age.
--- Page 12 ---
3. Keep away from the green colour and sister-in-law. Do not keep a silver pot or kettle with a snout (Toti) in it in the house. 4. Offer water to the roots of a Banyan tree whenever you can afford. 5. Insert copper nails on the four corners of your bed. 6. Whenever crossing a river, always throw coins in it for the welfare of your children. 7. Always keep a silver Thali in your house. 8. Use Silver pots for drinking water or milk and avoid the use of glassware for the same. Moon in 2nd House The results of the 2nd house, when Moon is placed therein, will be influenced by Jupiter, Venus and the Moon, because this is the Puckka Ghar, the permanent house of Jupiter and Venus is the lord of the second Rashi Taurus. The Moon gives very good results in this house, as it becomes very strong here because of the friendly support of Jupiter against Venus. Such a native may not have sisters, but will certainly be having brothers. In case he doesn(cid:146)t have, his wife will certainly have brothers. He will certainly receive his due share in parental properties. Whatever be the planetary position otherwise, but the Moon here will ensure male offspring to the native. The native will receive good education, which will add to his fortune. The Business associated with the things of the Moon will prove highly advantageous. He may be a reputed teacher also. The Ketu placed in the 12th house will cause eclipse of the Moon here, which will deprive the native either of good education or of male children. Remedies 1. Temple within the native(cid:146)s house may deprive the native of male issue. 2. The things associated with the Moon, i.e., silver, rice, non-cemented floor of the house, the mother and old women and their blessings will prove very lucky for the native. 3. Offering green colour clothes to small girls continuously for 43 days. 4. Place the things associated with the Moon into the foundation of your house, e.g., a square piece of silver. Moon in 3rd House The results of the 3rd house, when the Moon is placed therein, will be influenced by the Mars, Mercury and Moon. Here the Moon proves highly beneficial to ensure a long life and great wealth or riches for the native. If there are no planets in the 9th and 11th houses, then Mars and Venus will give good results to the native because of the Moon being in the 3rd house. With the advancement of the native(cid:146)s education and learning, the economic condition of his father will deteriorate, but without affecting his education adversely. If Ketu(cid:146)s placing in the horoscope is auspicious and not harming the Moon in the 3rd, the education of the native will bear good fruits and prove advantageous in every manner. If the Moon is malefic, it will cause great loss of wealth and money at the age of the malefic planet placed in the 9th house. Remedies 1. Offer in donation the things associated with the Moon, e.g., silver or rice, after the birth of a
--- Page 13 ---
daughter and the things associated with the Sun e.g., wheat and jaggery when a son is born. 2. Do not make use of your daughter(cid:146)s money and wealth. 3. To avoid the evil effects of a malefic planet in the 8th house, serve the guests and others by offering them milk and water freely. 4. Worshipping Goddess Durga and obtaining the blessings of small girls by touching their feet after serving them food and sweets. Moon in 4th House The results of the 4th house are the general product of the total influences of Moon, the lord of the 4th Rashi Cancer and the permanent resident of the 4th house.

Venus and Mercury combined together give the effects of the Sun. The 1st house aspects the 7th house.

In this way the Moon here will destroy its enemy Ketu(cid:146)s things, i.e., the sons of the native. Here the Moon will have to face the combined power of its enemies Saturn and Ketu, which will weaken the Moon. Now if Ketu is placed in the 4th house, the life of the native(cid:146)s mother will be endangered. The business associated with Mercury will also prove harmful.

Moon in 12th house This house belongs to Moon(cid:146)s friend Jupiter. Here the Moon will have good effects on Mars and the things associated with Mars, but it will harm its enemies Mercury and Ketu and the things associ- ated with them. Hence the business and things associated with the house in which Mars is placed will provide highly beneficial effects. Similarly, the business and things associated with the houses where Mercury and Ketu are placed will be strongly damaged. The Moon in the 12th houses causes a general fear in the native(cid:146)s mind about numerous unforeseen troubles and dangers and thus de- stroys his sleep and peace of mind. Ketu in the 4th house will become weak and affect the native(cid:146)s son and mother very adversely. Remedies 1.

4. Mars : Effects And Remedies Mars is a dry, red and fiery planet. Masculine by nature it signifies energy, both constructive and destructive depending upon his position as Mars posi- tive and Mars negative. If Sun and Mercury are placed together in one house, Mars would be positive but if Saturn and Sun are placed in one house Mars becomes negative. Mars acts on the extremes - either soft like a wax or hard like a stone. The Sun, Moon and Jupiter are his friends, whereas Mercury and Ketu are his enemies. Rahu and Saturn are neutral to Mars. The first cycle of Mars runs between the ages 28 and 33, the 2nd between 63 and 68 years and the 3rd between 98 and 103 years. The 1st and 8th houses are the own houses of Mars and he gets exalted in the 10th house of his debilitation. Mars acts as a malefic in the 4th and 8th houses, but he is benefic if placed in the 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12th houses. Mars is the significator of sex, brothers, land and property and rules over the animal instincts in man. A benefic Mars offers self confidence, sharp wit, faculty of argumentation and adventurous spirit, strong determination and qualities of leadership in all human pursuits. On the contrary, a weak and afflicted Mars makes the native lose temper quickly, fool hardy, quarrelsome and brutal. Such a Mars makes the native a sexual pervert. The general effects and remedial measures of Mars according to Lal Kitab can be delineated as follows : Mars in Ist House Mars in the 1st house makes the native good natured, truthful and richer from the 28th year of age. He wins favours from the government and victory against the enemies without much effort. He earns large profits from the business associated with Saturn i.e., iron, wood, machinery etc. and the relatives represented by Saturn i.e., nephews, grandsons, uncles etc. Spontaneous curses from the mouth of such a native will never go waste. Association of Saturn with Mars provides physical trouble to the native. Remedies 1. Avoid the acceptance of things free of cost or in charity. 2. Avoid evil deeds and telling lies. 3. Association with saints and Faqirs will prove very harmful. 4. Things of ivory will give very adverse effects. Avoid them. Mars in 2nd House The native with Mars in the 2nd house is generally the eldest issue of his parents, or else he or she would always like to be treated so. But living and behaving like a younger brother would prove highly beneficial and ward off several evils automatically. Mars in this house provides great wealth and properties from the in-laws(cid:146) family. Mars negative here makes the native a snake in disguise for others and causes his death in war or quarrels. Mars with Mercury in the 2nd house weakens the will power and undermines the importance of the
--- Page 18 ---
native. Remedies 1. The business associated with Moon, e.g., trade in cloth, will provide great prosperity, hence strengthen Moon. 2. Ensure that your in-laws make arrangements for providing drinking water facilities to the com- mon people. 3. Keep deer skin in the house. Mars in 3rd House The 3rd house is affected by Mars and Mercury, who provide brothers and sisters to the native i.e., he will not be the only issue of his parents. Others will be highly benefited from the native, but he will not be able to receive benefit from others. Humbleness will bring rewards. In-laws will become richer and richer after the native(cid:146)s marriage. The native believes in the principle (cid:147) eat, drink and be merry(cid:148) and suffers from blood disorders. Remedies 1. Be soft hearted and avoid arrogance. Be good to brothers for prosperity. 2. Keep articles of ivory with you . 3. Put on silver ring in the left hand. Mars in 4th House The 4th house is overall the property of Moon. The fire and heat of Mars in this house burns the cold water of Moon i.e., the properties of the Moon are adversely affected.

Such a native affects the life of his mother, wife, mother-in-law etc very adversely. His anger becomes the cause of his overall destruction in various aspects of life. Remedies 1. Offer sweet milk to the roots of a banyan tree and put that wet soil on your navel. 2. To avoid havoc from fire, place empty bags of sugar on the roof of your house, shop or factory. 3. Always keep a square piece of silver with you. 4. Keep away from black, one-eyed or disabled person. Mars in 5th House The 5th house belongs to the Sun, who is a natural friend of Mars. Hence Mars ensures very good results in this house. The sons of the native become instruments of wealth and fame for him. His prosperity increases manifold after the birth of sons. The things and relatives represented by Venus and Moon will prove beneficial in every manner. Someone of his forefathers must have been a doctor or Vaidya. The prosperity of the native will continue to grow more and more with the growth in age. But romance and emotional affairs with the opposite sex will prove highly disastrous for the native, which will destroy his mental peace and night sleep too. Remedies 1. Maintain a good moral character.

The native will be courageous, adven- turous, lover of justice and powerful enough to set fire into water. He will be highly benefited by the trade and business associated with Mercury. His pen will wield more power than the sword. If Sun, Saturn and Mars are placed together in one house, the brothers, mother, sisters and wife will be affected very adversely. Remedies 1. Distribute salt in place of sweets on the birth of a male child. 2. His brothers should keep the native happy by offering him something or the other for their protection and prosperity.

Worship Ganeshji for parents(cid:146) health and de- struction of enemies. Mars in 7th House This house belongs to the influences of Venus and Mercury, who combined together provide the effect of Sun. If Mars is placed therein, the 7th house will be affected by Sun and Mars both, which ensures that the native(cid:146)s ambition will be fulfilled. Wealth, property and family will increase. But if Mercury is also placed here alongwith Mars, very adverse results will follow regarding the things and relations represented by Mercury e.g., sister, sister-in-law, nurses, maid servant, parrot, goats etc. Hence it would be better to keep away from them. Remedies 1. Place solid piece of silver in the house for prosperity. 2. Always offer sweets to daughter, sister, sister-in-law and widows. 3. Repeatedly build a small wall and destroy it. Mars in 8th House The 8th house belongs to Mars and Saturn, who jointly influence the properties of this house. No planet is considered good in this house.

If the native is born in a poor family, his family will become rich and affluent after his birth. If he is born in a rich family, his family will grow richer and richer after his birth. If the native is the eldest brother he will gain a more distinct recognition and reputation in society. He will be bold, courageous, healthy and com- petent enough to set traditions, norms and rules in society. However, if malefic planets Rahu, Ketu and Saturn or Venus and Moon are placed in the 2nd house, the aforesaid beneficial effects are reduced. Further if a friendly planet is placed in the 3rd house, it will also affect the results of Mars in the 10th house adversely. If Saturn is placed in the 3rd house, the native will gain huge wealth and large properties in the later part of his life along with a kingly position. Mars in the 10th house but no planet in the 5th house provides all round prosperity and happiness. Remedies 1. Do not sell ancestral property and gold of the house. 2.

5. Mercury : Effects & Remedies In astrological parlance Mercury has been understood as an externally vari- able, vacillating, convertible, neutral and dualistic planet. Mercury reflects the mentality of an individual, governs the reaction to our senses and impres- sions and rules over the central nervous system. As an intellectual planet it represents intelligence, genius, analytic power and reproductibility. Mercury is the smallest planet of the solar system. The author of Lal Kitab has compared Mercury with a bat, which keeps hanging upside down and pounces upon the face of a child at the first opportunity. The native fails to understand anything and meanwhile the mysterious and mischie- vous Mercury turns the cycle of fortune in the reverse gear. Mercury produces the effects of the planet or planets it is associated with. Mercury is considered malefic in the 3rd, 8th, 9th and 12th houses. Rahu gives bad results in 1, 5, 7, 8 and 11th houses. If Mercury and Rahu both are in their auspicious houses then Mercury causes havoc in the natives houses and produces disastrous result like putting the native behind the bars or creating troubles of the same sort. Mercury is considered auspicious in the 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and the 7th houses and gives bad results when placed in the 3, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12th. Its colour is green and Moon is its enemy.

Mercury in 1st House Mercury in 1st house makes the native kind, humorous and diplomatic with administrative skill. Such a native generally lives long and becomes selfish and mischievous by nature having special attraction for non-vegetarian dishes and drinks. He receives favour from the government and his daughters have royal and luxurious lives. The relatives represented by the house in which Sun is placed gain wealth and riches within a little time and he himself will be having many sources of income. If Sun is placed along with Mercury in the 1st house or if the Mercury is aspected by Sun the wife of native will come from a rich and noble family and will be good natured. Such a native will be affected by the evil effects of Mars but Sun will never give bad effects. Rahu and Ketu will have evil effects, which suggests that the in laws and the offspring of the native will be adverse. If Mercury is in the 1st house, the native will be adept in the art of influencing others and he will live like a king.

Higher attributes of the mind and soul, generosity, joy, jubilation and joviality along with high reasoning ability and the power of right judgement are all governed by Jupiter. Jupiter rules educational interests, law, religion, phi- losophy, banking, economics and indicates the extent of one(cid:146)s love and longing for religion, scriptures, elders and preceptors.

A malefic Jupiter affects the Ketu (son) very adversely. Jupiter offers malefic results if he is placed with Saturn, Rahu or Ketu in a horoscope. Jupiter in 1st House Jupiter in the Ist house makes the native necessarily rich, even if he is deprived of learning and education. He will be healthy and never afraid of enemies. He will rise every 8th year of his life through his own efforts and with the help of friends in the government. If the 7th house is not occupied by any planet success and prosperity will come after the marriage of the native. Mar- riage or construction of a house with one(cid:146)s own earnings in the 24th or 27th year would prove inauspicious for the longevity of the father(cid:146)s life. Jupiter in Ist house along with the Saturn in the 9th house causes health problems for the native. Jupiter in the Ist house and Rahu in the 8th causes the death of the native(cid:146)s father because of heart attack or asthma. Remedies 1. Offer the things of Mercury, Venus and Saturn to the religious places. 2. Serving cows and helping untouchables. 3. If Saturun is placed in the 5th house, don(cid:146)t build a house. 4. If Saturn is placed in the 9th house, don(cid:146)t buy machinery associated with Saturn. 5. If Saturn is in 11th or 12th house, avoid use wine, meat and eggs strictly. 6. Ward-off the evil effects of Mercury by putting on silver in the nose. Jupiter in 2nd House The results of this house are affected by Jupiter and Venus as if they are together in this house, though Venus may be placed anywhere in the chart. Venus and Jupiter are inimical to each other. Hence both will affect each other adversely. Consequently, if the native engages himself in the trade of gold or jewellery, then the things of Venus like wife, wealth and property will get destroyed. As long as the wife of the native is with him, the native will continue gaining honour and wealth despite the fact that his wife and her family may be suffering because of ill health and other prob-
--- Page 27 ---
lems. The native is admired by females and inherits the property of his father. He may be benefited by lottery or property of a person having no issues, if the 2nd, 6th and 8th houses are auspicious and Saturn is not placed in the 10th. Remedies 1. Charity and donations will ensure prosperity. 2. Offer milk to snakes for warding off the evils of Saturn placed in the 10th. 3. Fill up the pits if any on the road side, in front of your house. Jupiter in 3rd House The jupiter in the 3rd house makes the native learned and rich, who receives continuous income from the government all through his life. Saturn in the 9th makes the native live long, whereas if Saturn is placed in the 2nd the native becomes extremely clever and crafty. However Saturn is the 4th indicates that the native will be robbed of money and wealth by his friends. If Jupiter is accom- panied by inimical planets in the 3rd the native is destroyed and becomes a liability on his closer ones. Remedies 1. Worship of Goddess Durga and offering sweets and fruits to small girls and obtaining their blessing by touching their feet. Avoid sycophants. Jupiter in 4th House The 4th house belongs to Moon, a friend of Jupiter, who stands exalted in this house. Hence Jupiter here gives very good results and provides the native the powers of deciding the fate and fortune of others. He will possess money, wealth and large properties along with honour and favours from the government. In times of crisis the native will receive divine help. As he grows old his prosperity and money will increase. How so ever if he has built a temple at home Jupiter will not give the above mentioned results and the native will have to face poverty and disturbed married life. Remedies 1. The native should not keep a temple in his house. 2. He should serve his elders. 3. He should offer milk to snake. 4. He should never bare his body before anyone. Jupiter in 5th House This house belongs to Jupiter and Sun. Native(cid:146)s prosperity will increase after the birth of his son. In fact, more sons a native has, the more prosperous he will become. 5th house is the own house of Surya and in this house Surya, Ketu and Brihaspati will give mixed results. However if Mercury, Venus and Rahu is in 2nd, 9th, 11th or 12th houses then Jupiter Sun and Ketu will give bad results. If the native is honest and laborious then Jupiter will give good results. Remedies 1. Do not accept any donations or gifts. 2. Offers your services to priests and sadhus. Jupiter in 6th House 6th house belongs to Mercury and Ketu also has its effect on this house. So this house will give
--- Page 28 ---
combined effects of Mercury, Jupiter and Ketu. If Jupiter is benefic the native will be of pious nature. He will get everything in life without asking. Donations and offerings in the name of elders will prove beneficial. If Jupiter is in 6th and Ketu is benefic then native will become selfish. How- ever, if Ketu is malefic in 6th house and Mercury is also malefic the native will be unlucky upto 34 years of age. Here Jupiter causes asthma to the native(cid:146)s father Remedies 1. Offer things connected with Jupiter in a temple. 2. Feed the cocks. 3. Offer clothes to the priest. Jupiter in 7th House 7th house belongs to Venus, so it will give mixed results. The native will have rise in luck after marriage and native will be involved in religious works. The good result of the house will depend upon position of Moon. The native will never be a debtor and will have good children. And if the sun is also in 1st house the native will be a good astrologer and lover of comforts. However if Jupiter is malefic in 7th house and Saturn is in the 9th the native will become a thief. If Mercury is in the 9th then his married life will be full of probelms. If Jupiter is malefic native will never get support from brothers and will be deprived of favours from the government. Jupiter in 7th house causes differences with the father. If so one should never donate clothes to anyone, other- wise one will certainly get reduced to extreme poverty. Remedies 1. Offer worship to lord Shiva. 2. One should not keep idols of God in ones house. 3. Keep gold tied in a yellow cloth always with you. 4. One should stay away from yellow clad Sadhus and Faqirs. Jupiter in 8th House Jupiter does not give good results in this house, but one will get all the worldly comforts. In the time of distress, one will get help from God. Being religious will increase native(cid:146)s luck. As long as the native is wearing gold he will not be unhappy or ill. If there is Mercury, Venus or Rahu in 2nd, 5th, 9th, 11th and 12th house, native(cid:146)s father will be ill and native himself will face loss of prestige. Remedies 1. Offer things connected with Rahu, like wheat, barley, coconut into running water. 2. Plant a Pipal tree in a cremation ground. 3. Offer Ghee and potatoes and camphor in temple. Jupiter in 9th House 9th house is especially influenced by Jupiter. So the native will be famous, rich and will be born in a rich family. The native will be true to his words and will have long life and have good children. In case Jupiter is malefic the native will have none of these qualities and will be atheistic. If the native has any planet inimical to Jupiter in the 1st, 5th and 4th house then Jupiter will give bad results. Remedies

Throw copper coins in the running water of a river for 43 days. 3. Offer almonds to religious places. 4. A temple with idols must not be established within the house. 5. Put Tilak of saffron on the forehead. Jupiter in 11th House Jupiter in this house affects the things and relatives of his enemies Mercury, Venus and Rahu very adversely. Consequently, the wife of the native will remain miserable. Similarly, sisters, daughters and father(cid:146)s sisters will also remain unhappy. The native will be a debtor even if Mercury is well placed. The native will be comfortable only as long as his father lives with him in a joint family along with brothers, sisters and mother.

7. Venus : Effects And Remedies As a feminine planet, Venus has been regarded as the goddess of love, marriage, beauty and all worldly comforts. Venus represents that power of love which leads to the merger of two individual selves into one and rules the gentle and refined attributes of human life. As a preceptor of demons, Venus stands for the husband in the horoscope of a female and represents the wife in the horoscope of a male. Venus offers good results if placed alone in the birth chart. The 2nd and 7th houses are owned by Venus who gets exalted in the 12th house. Saturn, Mercury and Ketu are friends of Venus, whereas Sun, Moon and Rahu act as enemies. Venus offers very good results if posited in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th and 12th houses, but the Ist, 6th and 9th houses are considered bad for Venus. Accordingly, Venus offers very good results in the houses of Mercury, Saturn and Ketu, whereas evil effects will follow if posited in the houses of Sun, Rahu and Moon. When Rahu aspects Venus or vice versa, or when both are placed together in a house, the good results of Venus will be nullified and the native will get deprived of money, wealth and family comforts altogether. The eyes of the native(cid:146)s, mother will become severely defective if Moon and Venus are placed just opposite to each other. Afflicted Venus causes trouble in the eyes, diseases of the ovaries, gout, anaemia and other compli- cations due to over indulgence in amusements and sex, including gonorrhoea and syphilis. An afflicted Venus may cause vehicular accidents, faithlessness in love and marriage and will deprive the native of the comforts of vehicles, conveyance etc. Venus in Ist House Venus in Ist house makes the native highly handsome, long lived, sweet tongued and popular among the opposite sex.

Business or trade associated with gold and jewellery will be extremely harmful. Business associated with earthen goods, agriculture and animal will prove highly
--- Page 31 ---
beneficial. Venus in 2nd second house in a female horoscope renders the native barren or infertile and in a male (cid:145)s horoscope makes the wife incapable of producing a son. Remedies 1. For getting a son, intake of things associated with Mars, like honey, Saunf or Deshi Khand will be highly effective. 2. Feed two kgs of potatoes coloured by yellow turmeric to cows. 3. Offer two kgs. cow(cid:146)s Ghee in a temple. 4. Avoid adultery. Venus in 3rd House Here Venus blesses the native with a charming personality and every woman would get attracted to him. He is generally loved by all.

She would be courageous, supportive and helpful to the native like second bullock of the cart. He will be saved from deceit, theft and harm from others.

Venus in 4th House Venus in 4th house strongly establishes the possibility of two wives and makes the native rich, too, If Jupiter is posited in 10th house and Venus is placed in 4th, the native will face adverse results from all sides if he tries to be religious.

8. Saturn : Effects And Remedies As the slowest moving planet and the chief significator for longevity, Saturn is a barren, binding, cold, dry, hard, defensive and secretive planet. Its effects and influences are felt with greater intensity and for longer periods than any other planet. Saturn is considered to be very favourable for people born in the signs owned by Venus, whereas Saturn is evil to those born in the signs owned by Mer- cury. The astrological thesis of Lal Kitab describes Saturn as a serpent, whose head or mouth is Rahu and Ketu is its tail. If Ketu is posited in earlier houses than Saturn, the latter becomes a great benefic for the native. However, if the position is otherwise, the Saturn throws highest poisonous results on the native. Further, Saturn never gives malefic effects if posited in houses of Jupiter i.e. 2, 5, 9 or 12, whereas Jupiter provides bad results if posited in the house of Saturn. Saturn is considered good in houses 2nd , 3rd and 7th to 12th, whereas 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th houses are bad for Saturn. Sun, Moon and Mars are its enemies, Venus, Mercury and Rahu are friends and Jupiter and Ketu are neutral to it. Saturn gets exalted in 7th house and the 1st house is the house of its debilitation. Venus and Jupiter placed together act like Saturn in that house. Similarly Mars and Mercury placed in a single house act like Saturn in that house. In the former case Saturn behaves like Ketu, while in the latter case it behaves like Rahu. Venus gets destroyed if Saturn is being aspected by the Sun in any horoscope. The aspect of Venus on Saturn causes loss of money and wealth, but the aspect of Saturn on Venus proves highly benefi- cial. Collision of Saturn and Moon causes operation of the eyes of the native.

Saturn in 3rd house deprives the native of the accumulation of cash money and kills the children of the native when posited in 5th house and 10th house is empty. It becomes highly benefic in 12th house if friendly planets are posited in 2nd house. Saturn provides very good results if placed in houses 1 to 7 on the condition that 10th house is empty. Saturn in 1st house and Sun in 7th, 10th or 11th houses causes all sorts of troubles for native(cid:146)s wife. Combination of Mars and Saturn gives adverse results al through. Saturn in Ist House 1st house is influenced by Sun and Mars. Saturn in 1st house will give good results only when 3rd, 7th or 10th houses are not inhabited by any planet which is inimical to Saturn.

9. Rahu:Effects And Remedies Unlike other planets of the solar system Rahu and Ketu are not observable, substantial heavenly bodies, with shape or mass content. Rightly termed as shadowy planets, their movement is interrelated and as parts of one body they are at all times just opposite to each other . Greater significance has been attached to the role of Rahu in influencing human affairs in various dimen- sions, especially in Kaliyug. The author of Lal Kitab describes Saturn as a serpent and Rahu and Ketu as its head and tail respectively. As a node of Moon, Rahu shall not provide adverse results so long as 4th house or Moon is not afflicted. He gives good results when Mars occupies houses 3 and 12, or when Sun and Mercury are in house 3, or when he himself is posited in 4th house. Rahu further provides good results if placed together with Mercury or aspected by him. Rahu offers highly beneficial effects if placed in houses earlier than Saturn. But if it is otherwise, Saturn becomes stronger and Rahu acts as his agent. Sun provides very good results when Rahu is aspected by Saturn, but Rahu gives the effects of a debilitated planet when Saturn is aspected by Rahu. Rahu gets exalted in houses 3 and 6, whereas he gets debilitated in houses 8, 9 and 11. 12th house is his (cid:145)Pakka Ghar(cid:146) and he proves highly auspicious in houses 3,4 and 6. Saturn, Mercury and Ketu are his friends, whereas Sun, Mars and Venus are his enemies. Jupiter and Moon are neutral to him. If Sun and Venus are placed together in a horoscope, Rahu will generally provide adverse results. Similarly, Rahu will provide bad results if Saturn and Sun are also combined in a horoscope. Here Mars will also become Mars negative. If Ketu is placed in houses earlier than Rahu, Rahu will provide adverse results, whereas Ketu(cid:146)s effect would be zeroed. Rahu in 1st House 1st house is influenced by Mars and Sun, which is like a throne. The planet in 1st house is consid- ered to be the king of all planets. The native will achieve a position higher than indicated by his qualification and will obtain good results from govern- ment. Rahu in this house would give the result of exalted Sun, but it will spoil the fruits of the house in which Sun is placed. If Mars, Saturn and Ketu are weak only then Rahu would give bad results, otherwise it will give good results in 1st house.

10. Ketu : Effects And Remedies Ketu, according to the author of Lal Kitab, represents son, grandson, ear, spine etc. 6th house is considered to be its (cid:145)Pucca Ghar.(cid:146) It gives its exalted effect when in 5th, 9th or 12th house and its debilitated effect in 6th and 8th house. Dawn is its time and it represents Sunday. Ketu represents the opposite node of Ketu, in the tail of the serpent. Its colours are black and white. Venus and Rahu are its friends, whereas Moon and Mars are its enemies . Forty two years is the age of Ketu. Ketu is also considered to be the bed. So the bed given by in-laws after marriage is considered to be auspicious for the birth of a son and as long as that bed is in the house, the effect of Ketu can never be inauspicious. Ketu in 1st House If Ketu is auspicious or benefic in this house, the native will be laborious, rich and happy, but will always be concerned and troubled because of his progeny. He may fear frequent transfers or travels, but ultimately it would always be postponed. Whenever Ketu comes in 1st house in Varsha Kundli there may be birth of a son or nephew. There may also be a long journey. The native with Ketu in 1st house will always be beneficial for his father and/or Guru and causes exaltation of Sun. If Ketu in 1st house is malefic, the native would suffer from headache. His wife would have health problems and would have worries concerning kids. If 2nd and 7th houses are empty then Mercury and Venus would also give bad results. There would be travels, transfers with no gain. If Saturn is malefic it would destroy father and Guru.

If Ketu in 2nd house is benefic then one gets paternal property. One has to travel a lot and his travels are fruitful. Venus gives good results, irrespective of its position. Moon would give bad results. If Sun is in 12th house then one starts earning his livelihood after twenty four years and is happy. If Jupiter is exalted along with Ketu in 2nd house, then income would be in lacs of rupees. If Ketu in 2nd house is malefic, then one has to travel to dry areas. One cannot rest at one place and would be wandering from place to place. Income may be good, but so would be the expenditure. Thus net gain would be negligible. If there is Moon or Mars in 8th house then native(cid:146)s life would
--- Page 44 ---
be short and he would have serious problem at the age of sixteen or twenty years. If 8th house is empty then Ketu would give malefic results. Remedies 1. Apply turmeric or saffron as Tilak. 2.

If Ketu is in 3rd house and Mars is in 12th then the native has a son before 24th year of age. The son would be good for wealth and longevity of the native. The native with Ketu in 3rd house usually gets a job, which entails long travels. If Ketu in 3rd house is malefic then native loses money in litigation. He gets separated from his wife/sisters-in-law. If such a native lives in a house with its main gate facing south, he will have serious problems regarding children. Such a native cannot say no to any thing and so will always have worries. He will have troubles from his brothers and will have to travel uselessly. Remedies 1. Use saffron as Tilak. 2. Wear gold. 3. Offer jaggery, rice in flowing water. Ketu in 4th house 4th house belongs to Moon, which is an enemy of Ketu.

The son born lives long. Such a native leaves all his decisions to God. If Moon is in 3rd or 4th house the result is benefic. Such a native is a good adviser and will never have shortage of money. If Ketu is malefic in this house then the native is unhealthy, his mother is troubled, there is loss of happiness. One may suffer from diabetes. A son is born after thirty six years of age. Such a native has more daughters than sons. Remedies 1. Keep a dog. 2. Wear silver for peace of mind. 3. Offer yellow things in flowing water. Ketu in 5th House 5th house belongs to Sun.

The native is a good adviser. If Jupiter is benefic then the native has a long life and his mother is happy and the life is peaceful.

The native has to suffer due to useless travels. People turn into enemies without any reason. The native suffers from skin diseases.

The wealth increases in proportion to the children one has. The native(cid:146)s enemies are frightened of the native. If one has the help of Mercury, Jupiter or Venus then the native is never disappointed. If Ketu in 7th house is malefic then the native is usually ill, makes false promises and is troubled by enemies till thirty four years of age. If there are more than one planet in Lagna then ones children are destroyed. If one abuses then the native is destroyed. If Ketu is with Mercury then after thirty four years of age the native(cid:146)s enemies are destroyed by themselves. Remedies 1. Never make a false promise, be proud, or abusive. 2. Use saffron as Tilak. 3. In case of serious trouble use the remedies of Jupiter.

Ketu in 8th house 8th house belongs to Mars, which is an enemy of Ketu. If Ketu in 8th house is benefic then the native begets a son at thirty four years of age, or after the marriage of ones sister or daughter. If Jupiter or Mars are not in 6th and 12th house then Ketu does not give malefic results. Similar effect is there when Moon is in 2nd house. If Ketu in 8th house is malefic then the native(cid:146)s wife has ill health. Son will not be born, or may die. The native may suffer from diabetes or urinary problem. If Saturn or Mars are in 7th then the native is unlucky. In case of malefic Ketu in 8th house the native(cid:146)s character determines the health of his wife. After twenty six years of age the family life suffers. Remedies 1. Keep a dog. 2. Donate a black and white blanket in any temple. 3. Worship Lord Ganesha. 4. Wear gold in the ear. 5. Use saffron as Tilak. Ketu in 9th House 9th house belongs to Jupiter, which favours Ketu. Ketu in 9th house is considered to be exalted. Such a native is obedient and lucky. It increases ones wealth. If Ketu is benefic then one earns wealth through ones own labour. There will be progress but no transfer. If one keeps gold brick in his house then wealth comes. The son of such a native is able to guess the future. One spends a big part of his life in foreign land . One has at least three sons and if 2nd house is auspicious then Ketu gives excellent results . If Moon is auspicious then the native helps his mother(cid:146)s family.

11. Striking Principles and Precautions The author of Lal Kitab has enunciated such significant principles of astrol- ogy that stand well tested today and as such they are of utmost importance in our day to day life. In view of this, an effort is being made here to describe some unfailing principles and astrological precautions for the benefit of people at large. Residential Houses To begin with, no temple with idols should be constructed even for individual worship in a residen- tial house. However, keeping photos or drawings of deities on paper is not prohibited. This is highly inauspicious for the natives born with Jupiter in 7th house. If there is a small dark room at the end of the house, where there is no passage for air or light, the same should be left as it is and no attempt should be made to facilitate natural light through opening windows etc. in that room; otherwise, misfortunes will strike the residents. Places where ornaments or money is kept secretly must not be left empty. If there is nothing to be kept, please put some dry fruits there. There must necessarily be some uncemented place in a house. But if it is not feasible, the articles related to Venus must be installed and established therein. Safe Delivery and Longevity of Children (cid:149) Worship of lord Ganesh is highly auspicious for children and property. (cid:149) For safe delivery of children, a milk pot filled with milk and a sugar pot filled with sugar must be touched by the delivering mother and kept at some different place. After the delivery both the pots should be offered to some temple and should not be brought back from there. Good effects will multiply if the quality of the pots is good. (cid:149) If one(cid:146)s children do not survive the native must distribute salty preparations in place of sweets, to celebrate the birth of the child. Alms and Charity (cid:149) Digging of wells or providing drinking water facilities for public is strictly prohibited for those with Moon in 6th house of the birth chart. Any violation of the above would invite utter destruction and extreme poverty. (cid:149) Building of Dharmshalas, Sarais or inns is strictly prohibited for those having Saturn in 8th house. (cid:149) Saturn in Lagna and Jupiter in 5th house cause death of children one after the other, if copper coins are given in charity. (cid:149) Jupiter in 10th and Moon in 4th cause false allegations and critical legal proceedings against the native if he builds temples or Gurudwaras. (cid:149) Financial aid to widows and scholarships to poor children are strictly prohibited for those having Venus in 9th house. (cid:149) Grave consequences would folllow if a native with Moon in 12th house opens schools for free education, or offers food to religious saints and Jogins.
--- Page 49 ---
(cid:149) Anyone having Jupiter in 7th house must not offer clothes to anyone in charity (cid:149) Donations in the morning and evening hours by persons having Sun in 7th or 8th house of their horoscope will produce highly harmful and poisonous effects. Adoption The younger brother should never go for adoption of children of the elder brother. At the same time he should also not arrange the free marriage of the daughter of his elder brother. These practices would certainly lead to disastrous consequences. Selection of Bridegrooms (cid:149) Saturn in 11th house makes the native desert his wife and children in young age, whereas Saturn in the boy(cid:146)s 2nd house proves inauspicious for the bride(cid:146)s family. (cid:149) Mercury and Rahu combining in houses 3, 8, 9, or 12 of the groom is also inauspicious for the bride(cid:146)s family. (cid:149) Venus and Ketu together in Lagna make the native impotent. (cid:149) The groom is likely to be of bad sexual habits and may destroy his wealth in that, if the planetary positions are as follows : (a) Sun in 6th and Mars in 10th with the afflicted 12th house. (b) Moon in Lagna and Jupiter in 11th house . (c) Jupiter and Venus in 10th house. Remedies Applicabale to All. (cid:149) Sweet loaves of bread, specially baked in Tandoor, should be offered to animals every month for warding off sickness, quarrels and other troubles, caused by Mars negative in the horoscope. (cid:149) Place a pot of water under the headside of the bed at night and pour it on a tree or plant in the morning. (cid:149) Taking meals in the kitchen is a strong safeguard against the mischiefs of Rahu. (cid:149) From one(cid:146)s own meal a Chapati or a piece of it must be offered to cows, crows and dogs for allround well being and prosperity. Further, we all believe that going to a temple for offering prayer is always a good thing, which must be admired and encouraged. But according to Lal Kitab, the native having a malefic planet, espe- cially Saturn in 8th house, when 2nd house is empty, must not visit temples or other places of worship. Rather he should bow his head from outside. Similarly, if planets occupying 6th, 8th and 12th houses are inimical to each other and 2nd house is not occupied by any planet, the native must avoid visiting temples and other religious places of worship. The most striking thing about Lal Kitab is that it enshrines due admiration for Vedic culture and philosophy of the Hindus. Living in a joint family has been suggested as a powerful remedial measure and if for some reason this is not possible the native should sleep on the bed sheet which was used by his father. In other cases the native has been asked to obtain the blessings of parents and elders etc. as an amulet against the evil. It is worth pointing out that such simple and innocent remedies have worked wonders in tested cases.
