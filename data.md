"document_title":"1. Lal Kitab : An Astrological Marvel"
"content_paragraph_1":"Lal Kitab, originally published in urdu language, enshrines such effective astrological principles and remedial measures that it has rightly been termed as “The Wonder Book” of Astrology. The science of palmistry too has been explained in such an exquisite manner that each of the 42 divisions of the human brain have been related to the different houses of a man’s birth chart in such a scientific manner that the sketch of the human brain reflects accurately on the lines of the palm. On the basis of these lines of the palm one can draw the actual horoscope of an individual and can do the placement of planets in various houses of the birth chart. The date of birth and the birth ascendant can be found out by reading the lines and mounts of the palm, which means that an individual’s accurate birth chart can be drawn by seeing the lines of his palm. Similarly, by studying the different aspects of a man’s residential house his birth chart can be accurately prepared on the basis of the sutras explained in the Lal Kitab."
"content_paragraph_2":"In addition to the above, Lal Kitab has announced unique remedial measures to solve chronic and critical human problems in day to day life.These measures do not require the practice of ordeals, yagnas, havans and other complicated and expensive rituals, which prove more troublesome for persons who are already in trouble because of the evil effects of certain planets. These measures are again different from Yantras, Mantras and Tantras, which give various adverse effects if not followed rigorously in all their minute details. The measures suggested in Lal Kitab are electrically effective in solving all kinds of human troubles and tensions, without inflicting harm on anybody i.e. these remedies are completely self defensive against the evils created by the planets without causing injury in anyway to anyone concerned."
"content_paragraph_3":"The first part of this great treatise contains the principles and Sutras for interpretation of horoscope, termed as “Vyakaran”. The birth chart of an individual is prepared like the traditional Parashar principles, but the only important difference is that the Rashis are not considered or taken into account for predictive astrology and, therefore, the digits indicating the Rashis in a traditional birth chart are scrapped. Secondly, for predictive purposes the ascendant is treated as the first house and it is regarded as the house of the first Rashi, i.e., Aries and counting progressively in a sequence upto the 12th house being that of Pisces.The specific principles of predictive astrology as per Lal Kitab are better summed up here as follows"
"content_paragraph_4":"1. The Sun as lord of the 5th, the Mercury as lord of the 3rd and 6th, the Jupiter as lord of the 9th and the Saturn as lord of the 10th are directly or indirectly in some form or the other are the Karakas of the father and his property. But the Jupiter and the Sun, Jupiter and Mercury or Jupiter and Saturn occupying any house jointly carry no relevance to the knowledge, about father or father’s property at all. Even Mercury and Sun, Mercury and Saturn or Sun and Saturn also sitting together behave in the same manner."
"content_paragraph_5":"2. If two or more inimical planets are occupying a single house, they will not behave as enemies. But it does not mean that they do not affect the influences of each other and show their own results of being in that house independently i.e. their conjuction does not affect their individual results."
"content_paragraph_6":"3. Friendly planets together occupying a house become extremely friendly and help each other in producing good and auspicious results."
"content_paragraph_7":"4. The 7th house is regarded as the Pucca Ghar (permanent house) of Mercury. If Mercury is placed in the 7th house of a horoscope, even the powerful planets like Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn occupying a Kendra, 2nd or 11th house can not affect the health of the native adversely."
"content_paragraph_8":"5. If a female planet is placed in any house along with Saturn and both are being aspected by any"
}
1:{
"point_general_1":"other planet, then the aspecting planet will become afflicted and affect adversely the persons and relatives of such aspecting planet as Karakas."
"point_6":"In general, all planets in their Pucca Ghar, own house or exalted house give good results. A planet in inimical house or in a house of debilitation gives bad results. If a planet is not placed in his Pucca Ghar and the same is occupied by a planet inimical to such planet, then that planet will destroy the good results of the house in which he stands placed."
"point_7":"While examining a horoscope, the 1st, 7th, 8th and 11th houses must be examined together as they are mutually interested. The planets in the ascendant is treated as a ruler and the one in the 7th acts as his minister. The planet in the 8th is the eye of that ruler, whereas the planet in the 11th house is the ruler's foot."
"point_7_sub_1":"More planets in the 7th house than the 1st house shows that the ruler does not have required control over his minister. If the planets in the 11th house are inimical to the planets in the first house, then they will not obey the command of the ruler i.e., the results of the 11th house will be adversely affected."
"point_7_sub_2":"The planets of the 8th house (eyes) guide the planets of the 7th house (minister) and control their actions and effects. If the planets of the 1st and 8th houses are friendly, then the planet in the 7th house can not play any mischief."
"point_7_sub_3":"Mars in the 7th is considered to be highly conducive for gaining large property. But if mercury is in the Lagna, it will destroy the properties. It will be destroyed because of the foolishness of the native, because here the Mercury being in the first house is Karakas of the native. At the same time if the Mercury is in the 8th house, it will again destroy the properties, but here the reasons for destruction will be unknown and invisible, because the active elements of the 8th house are always secretive and mysterious in nature over which the native has no control."
"point_7_sub_4":"Similarly, if the planets of the 1st and 11th houses destination are friendly, they will control the planets of the 7th house. If they are inimical, the results would be bad."
"point_7_sub_5":"The planets of the 1st house aspect the planets of the 7th house. If they are mutually inimical, then the bad results accrue because of the foolishness or unworthiness of the native. The planets of the 8th house aspect the planets of the 2nd house and thereby affect their results."
"point_8_intro":"2nd, 6th, 8th, 12th and 11th houses must also be examined simultaneously as follows :"
"point_8a":"The planets of the 8th house aspect the 2nd house and thereby affect the results of the 2nd house. The effects of the aspects of the planets of the 8th house over the 2nd house are affected by the planets of the 11th house - favourably if friendly and unfavourably if inimical."
"point_8b":"The planets of the 2nd house aspect the 6th house and affects its results. The planets of the 6th and 8th houses have secret relations with each other, because of which they also affect the planets of the 2nd house (+++)."
"point_8c":"The 12th house also affects the 2nd house (+++). If there are evil planets in the 6th and 8th houses, (because of their secret/implied conjunction) their evil power increases 10 times."
"point_8d":"If the planets in the 12th and 8th houses are inimical, the native should not visit temples and other places of worship."
"point_9_intro":"The 3rd, 11th, 5th, 9th and 10th houses must also be examined simultaneously as follows :"
"point_9a":"If there is any planet in the 3rd house, it will start showing effects after the birth of the native's younger brother."
"point_9b":"If the 9th and 5th houses are occupied by Saturn Rahu or Ketu then the unfavourable changes start coming up in the native's life just after the birth of the child."
"point_9c":"If there is no planet in the 4th house, or it is occupied by Rahu, Ketu or Saturn, then the good results of the 10th house will not be received by the native. If 10th and 2nd houses are empty, the good results of the 4th house will go waste."
"point_9d":"If the 3rd and 9th houses are bad, the 5th will also prove bad."
"point_9e":"If the 9th is occupied by Sun or Moon, the 5th house will give good results."
"point_9f":"If the 9th is occupied by Sun or Moon, then Rahu or Ketu in the 5th will neither affect the issues of the native or the native himself adversely."
"point_9g":"If Rahu or Ketu be placed in the 5th and there are inimical planets in the 8th then strokes of misfortune will hit the native through the 11th house. The relatives indicated by the planets of the 5th and 8th houses will also be affected. In this situation the earnings of the native will also be affected very adversely, if the 2nd house is empty. Nothing will be able to save the native. Now the planets of the 10th and 5th will also turn to be malefics whatever be their natural character."

"document_title":"Sun : Effects and Remedies"
"source_text_chapter":"The second chapter of Lal Kitab, termed as the wonder Book of Astrology, details the effects of Sun in various houses alongwith the remedies."
"introduction_paragraph_1":"The Sun, eulogised by the author of the Lal Kitab as Vishnu, the lord of presentation, is the father of our solar system, around which all planets resolve. The power of light in the sky, the temperature of the earth, the power of presentation and progress are represented by the sun. His presence means the “day” and absence means the “night”. The soul in human body and the power of rendering bodily services to others have also been referred to the Sun - a royal planet of power, authority and finances."
"introduction_paragraph_2":"The Sun provides good results if placed in houses 1 to 5,8,9,11 and 12. The 6th, 7th, and 10th are bad houses for the Sun. The Moon, the Jupiter and the Mars are the planets friendly to the Sun where the Saturn, Venus, Rahu and Ketu are enemies. The first is the Puekar Ghar, the permanent house and the house of exaltation of the Sun, whereas the 7th house is in the house of debilitation. The Mars in the 6th and Ketu in the 1st house make the Sun produce results of an exalted planet. If the Sun is exalted or placed in an auspicious house of a person's horoscope he is bound to rise higher and higher in power and position. If obstacles are created against him by a person that person is bound to meet his doom. Much better results are proposed if the Sun is in conjunction with Mercury."
"introduction_paragraph_3":"The Sun gives adverse effects with the things associated with the house in which he is placed. Consequently in the 1st house he will create health problems for the native. In the 2nd house he will affect the family and its comforts absolutely adversely."

"introduction_paragraph_5":"The Sun of the 9th house will destroy the comforts of the forefathers and perhaps deprive the native of their properties. In the 10th, the sun will affect the father adversely. The sun in the 11th increases and multiplies the income of the native manifold, if he does not augment the power of Saturn by cosumption of liquor, meat and eggs. The Sun in the 12th house destroys the comforts of the night hour sleep of the native."
"introduction_paragraph_6":"The Sun will not be able to harm Venus when sun is being aspected by Saturn because Saturn and Venus are great friends. On the contrary, if Saturn is being aspected by Sun, then the Sun will not be afraid of Saturn and he will destroy the Venus as both are natural enemies in the house where he is placed."
"introduction_paragraph_7":"The effects of the Sun in both the situations in different houses are as below :"

"title":"3. Moon : Effects and Remedies"
"introduction_paragraph_1":"As explained in the preceding issue, the Sun is regarded as the generator of power that gives spirit and life to all planets, the Moon is considered to be the conductor of power lent by Sun and rules over the lives of the individuals on this earth. Sun represents individuality, whereas Moon shows one's personality."
"moon_governs_paragraph_2":"Moon governs over impregnation, conception, birth of a child and the animal instinct. She represents mother, mother's family, grandmother, old women, horse, navigation, agricultural land, Lord Shiva, love, kindness, mental peace, heart, services rendered for other's welfare and the 4th house."
"moon_effect_houses_paragraph_3":"The Moon's effect comes up in the 16th, 51st and 86th year of the native and similarly its 1st cycle falls in the 24th year, the 2nd in the 49th year and the 3rd cycle falls in the 94th year of the native. The Jupiter, Sun and Mars are Moon's friends, whereas Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are inimical to her. For her protection, the Moon sacrifices her friendly planets - Sun, Mars or Jupiter. Moon is the Lord of 4th house, stands exalted in the 2nd house of Taurus and becomes debilitated in the 8th house of Scorpio. The Moon provides very good results if placed in houses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 whereas the 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th and 12th houses are bad for the Moon. The death of a domestic milch animal or a horse, drying up of a person's well or pond, the loss of the senses of touching and feeling are the signs of moon turning malefic."
"ketu_4th_house_paragraph_4":"The placement of the Ketu in the 4th house causes Matri Rina i.e. mother's debt. In such a situation pieces of silver of equal weight and size be collected from every member of the family and the same should be thrown together into the running water of a river. Consequently all the ill effects would be warded off."
"moon_in_1st_house_section_title":"Moon in 1st House"
"moon_in_1st_house_description_1":"In general, the 1st house belongs to Mars and Sun. When the moon is also placed therein, this house will come under the combined influences of the Mars, the Sun and the Moon i.e. all the 3 mutual friends will be treated as occupants of this house. The Sun and Mars will extend all friendly support to their natural friend Moon placed on the throne i.e. the ascendant house."
"moon_in_1st_house_description_2":"Such native will be soft-hearted and will inherit all the traits and qualities of his mother. He will be either the eldest brother or will certainly be treated so.

"page2_astrology_overview":"In astrological parlance Mercury has been understood as an externally variable, vacillating, convertible, neutral and dualistic planet. Mercury reflects the mentality of an individual, governs the reaction to our senses and impressions and rules over the central nervous system. As an intellectual planet it represents intelligence, genius, analytic power and reproducibility."
"page2_mercury_role_effects":"Mercury is the smallest planet of the solar system. The author of Lal Kitab has compared Mercury with a bar which keeps hanging upside down and pounces upon the face of a child at the first opportunity. The native fails to understand anything and meanwhile the mysterious and mischievous Mercury turns the circle of fortune in the reverse gear. Mercury produces the effects of the planet or planets it is associated with. Mercury is considered malefic in the 3rd, 8th, 9th and 12th houses. Rahu gives bad results in 1, 5, 7, 8 and 11th houses. If Mercury and Rahu both are in their auspicious houses then Mercury causes havoc in the natives houses and produces disastrous result like putting the native behind the bars or creating troubles of the same sort. Mercury is considered auspicious in the 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and the 7th houses and gives bad results even placed in the 3, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12th. Its colour is green and Moon is its enemy. Sun Venus and Rahu are friends, whereas Mars, Saturn, and Ketu are neutral to him. 7th house is the Pukka Ghar of Mercury. It stands exalted in the 6th house and gets debilitated in the 12th house. Affected Venus causes diseases of tooth and nervous system. If Mercury is placed alone in any house the native keeps running and wasting time here and there."
